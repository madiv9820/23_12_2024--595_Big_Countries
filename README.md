# [595. Big Countries](https://leetcode.com/problems/big-countries?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

- ### Problem Understanding:
    You need to find countries that are considered "big," based on either of the following criteria:
    1. **Area**: The country has an area of at least **3 million km²** (i.e., 3,000,000).
    2. **Population**: The country has a population of at least **25 million** (i.e., 25,000,000).

    For each qualifying country, return its **name**, **population**, and **area**.

- ### General Approach:
    1. **Identify Big Countries**:
        - A country is big if it satisfies **either** of the following conditions:
            - The **area** is greater than or equal to 3 million km².
            - The **population** is greater than or equal to 25 million people.

    2. **Select the Relevant Columns**:
        - After identifying the big countries, select the `name`, `population`, and `area` columns.

- ### Key Steps:
    1. **Filter** the data to include only the countries where:
        - `area >= 3000000` or `population >= 25000000`.
    2. **Select** the `name`, `population`, and `area` columns for the filtered rows.
    3. **Return** the result table with the qualifying countries.

- ### Intuition for Each Framework:
    - **SQL**: Use a `WHERE` clause with the condition `area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000`.
    - **PySpark**: Use the `.filter()` method with the conditions `(df['area'] >= 3000000) | (df['population'] >= 25000000)`.
    - **Pandas**: Use boolean indexing to filter rows where `area >= 3000000` or `population >= 25000000`.

- ### Common Points:
    - The task involves filtering the countries based on the two given conditions.
    - After filtering, select the relevant columns (`name`, `population`, and `area`).
    - The result will be a list of countries that satisfy the "big" criteria.

- ### Conclusion:
    - The approach is based on **filtering** countries by area or population and then **selecting** the necessary columns.
    - This logic is consistent across SQL, PySpark, and Pandas, with syntax differences specific to each tool.

- ### Code Implementation:
    - **SQL:**
        ```sql []
        SELECT
            name, population, area
        FROM World
        WHERE 
        population >= 25000000 OR
        area >= 3000000        
        ```
    - **PySpark:**
        ```python3 []
        def big_countries(world: pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame) -> pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame:
            output = world.filter((world.area >= 3000000)|
                                (world.population >= 25000000))\
                            .select(['name', 'population', 'area'])
            return output    
        ```
    - **Pandas:**
        ```python3 []
        def big_countries(world: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
            output = world[(world.area >= 3000000)|
                        (world.population >= 25000000)]
            output = output[['name', 'population', 'area']]
            output = pd.DataFrame(output)
            return output
        ```
